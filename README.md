# FAQ

- Q: I don't like how a feature is being made. Is there any way I can change it or disable it?
  - A: Every feature can be disabled, and most will be able to have their values changed.

- Q: What is the difference between HRP-Light and HRP-Full?
  - A: These are the two different core versions of HRP. 
    
    HRP-Full will have very large changes to both the server and the client, however, it is on pause until HRP-L 1.1 releases. It will use a new server that Vanilla clients are not compatible with. 
    
    HRP-Light is smaller, and mostly contains quality of life changes to the client. HRP-L 1.0 has very few server changes currently, although HRP-L 1.1 will have some bigger server changes that allow HRP-L 1.1 players to have new features. HRP-L is also compatible with the original, vanilla servers for Hellion.

    HRP-Light 1.0 and HRP-Light 1.1 are the <b>only</b> versions released currently. 

- Q: Do I need to own Hellion?
  - A: Unfortunately, you do need to own a legitimate copy of Hellion. Hellion Rescue Project will not work on pirated versions, and we will not provide support for those copies.
